# Introduction

```{note}
The {{poptus}} package is presently being developed as an alpha version.  In
particular, the content of this book is at best a rough draft and will likely
change.  Additionally interactivity of example notebooks might not work.
```

The book provides several examples for using the {{poptus}} package, each of
which can be opened with [Binder](https://jupyter.org/binder) for interactive
exploration using one of the icons at the top of the example.  As in the User
Guide, we identify two types of users of the {{poptus}} package:

1. Users of Python codes such as methods, models, or applications that were
   implemented using the {{poptus}} package's infrastructure
2. Developers of codes such as methods, models, or applications that would like
   to use the {{poptus}} package's infrastructure in their codes

The book's examples are divided into two sections to address the needs of each
type of users.

For detailed information regarding this package and its programmatic interface,
please refer to the {{poptus}} [User Guide](https://poptus.readthedocs.io).
